Historical Context: This page provides users with comprehensive information about the selected market index, including a graph depicting the evolution of the average stock price, the distribution of market capitalization, and the sector distribution.

Main libraries used: pandas and plotly.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Macroeconomic Factors: This page acts as a central hub for users to access educational resources related to stock market investing. It presents the historical trends and updates on various macroeconomic variables such as GDP, interest rates, inflation, unemployment rate, and consumer confidence.

3 Forecasting Pages: 

Prophet Predictor: is a model designed to capture seasonality, trends, and holiday effects in the data. It offers features like automatic changepoint detection and flexible seasonality modeling. Prophet is particularly suitable for medium to long-term forecasting tasks, especially when the data exhibits strong seasonal patterns.

Forecasting Dow: Holt-Winters is a classical forecasting model that considers the components of level, trend, and seasonality. It employs exponential smoothing and weighted averages to make predictions. Holt-Winters models can handle both additive and multiplicative seasonality and are often used for short-term forecasting tasks where the data exhibits consistent patterns over time. They are relatively simpler to implement compared to the other mentioned algorithms.In this page the user has the option to select the ticker and forecasting horizon. It is then provided a graph with actual + forecasted prices, buying recommendation and expect gain (%).

Stock price - forecasting: LSTM, on the other hand, is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture known for its ability to model sequential data effectively. It excels at capturing long-term dependencies and complex patterns in time series data. LSTM models can learn from past observations and adapt to changing patterns, making them well-suited for tasks requiring nonlinear relationships and longer-term forecasts. 


Main libraries used: statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters, prophet, tensorflow.keras.models, and tensorflow.keras.layers.
